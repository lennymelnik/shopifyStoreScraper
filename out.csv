3M Littmann® Classic III™ Stethoscope, 27" Tube,The Classic III™ stethoscope offers high acoustic sensitivity for exceptional performance, plus a versatile two-sided chestpiece with tunable diaphragms. The Classic III™ stethoscope is used by students and medical professionals alike to identify, listen to, and study heart, lung, and other body sounds for physical assessment, patient monitoring, and diagnosis. Tunable diaphragm technology lets clinicians hear different frequency sounds by simply adjusting the pressure on the chestpiece. Hold the chestpiece with light pressure to hear low frequency sounds; press a little more to hear higher frequency sounds. This time-saving feature allows the healthcare provider to focus on the patient, while the non-chill diaphragm provides patient comfort. Headset tension is easily adjusted for head size and comfort by squeezing together or pulling apart the eartubes. Snap-tight, soft-sealing eartips conform to individual ears for an excellent acoustic seal and comfortable fit. Eartips snap firmly onto the ends of the eartubes and, for safety, require a significant effort to remove. Resilient next-generation tubing retains its shape and flexibility even after folding tightly into a pocket. It provides longer stethoscope life due to improved resistance to skin oils and alcohol, and is less likely to pick up stains. Next-generation tubing is not made with natural rubber latex, a benefit to sensitive medical professionals and their patients. And, to play its part in the protection of human health and the environment, the next-generation tubing does not contain phthalate plasticizers.

Two-sided chestpiece with tunable diaphragms on both the adult and pediatric sides.
Single-piece tunable diaphragm is easy to attach, and easier to clean because its surface is smooth without crevices.
Pediatric side converts to a traditional open bell by replacing the single-piece diaphragm with a non-chill rim.
Next-generation tubing provides longer life due to improved resistance to skin oils and alcohol; less likely to pick up stains.
Small tunable diaphragm is useful for pediatric, small, or thin patients; around bandages; and for carotid assessment.

The chestpiece is designed for better orientation around blood-pressure cuffs and body contours, and provides clear, reliable acoustic performance. The tunable diaphragm allows the user to conveniently alternate between low- and high-frequency sounds without turning over the chestpiece.

Excellent acoustic seal and comfortable fit with patented 3M Littmann® snap-tight soft seal eartips.
Durability is demonstrated by the fact that the headset can be reliably flexed one million times.

Clinical trials support improved patient comfort, easier insertion and overall preference.
Sculpted to create a flatter, thinner surface that helps penetrate the skin with significantly greater ease for a smoother and gentler injection.

Body Armor® Night Splint - One Size Fits All,The DARCO Body Armor® Night Splint is the only night splint on the market today that actively engages the windlass mechanism of the foot resulting in a specific and sustained stretch to the plantar fascia and a sustained low load stretch to the flexor tendons, Achilles tendon, and calf muscles.

Features and Benefits
Loading the windlass mechanism naturally brings the foot/ankle to a near 90 degree angle thus eliminating the “lever effect” and the resulting pressure on the apex of the ankle present in other dorsal models.
Elastic connector ring allows for natural flexion of the foot and toes.
Low profile design allows for maximum user comfort and compliance.
One-size-fits-all
Indications
Plantar Fasciitis
Heel Spurs
Achilles Tendonitis

CompAIR Compressor Nebulizer System,CompAir is the smallest, lightest, most convenient tabletop nebulizer - ever. Weighing less than 10 oz., the CompAir NE-C801 compressor is extremely portable, giving you the ability to manage and treat yourself at your convenience, wherever you may be. When therapy is finished, CompAir is small enough to be tucked away in a cabinet or drawer.

Despite its size, Omron’s advanced design and engineering allows the CompAir to administer medication as effectively as table top models three times its size. Because of Omron’s exclusive Virtual Valve Technology (V.V.T.), the CompAir is smaller and lighter than most tabletop nebulizers. The Virtual Valve Technology allows the nebulizer to produce particles as fine as 5 um MMD, assuring optimum absorption even in the narrow branches of the lower airways for effective inhalation of medication.

Flyp Portable Handheld Nebulizer,The Flyp Portable HandheldNebulizer is lightweight, portable, and small enough to fit easily in your pocket. This convenient construction is complemented by the simple design that transports medication to your body with no masks, tubes, or filters. HypersoniQ technology utilizes an internal disc that vibrates at ultrasonic speed to provide a silent nebulizer that dispenses medications in significantly less time - approximately seven minutes for most treatments.

Features
Small, lightweight construction is easy to transport, fitting conveniently in your pocket.
Simple, intuitive design provides treatment with no extraneous additions.
Internal disc vibrates at ultrasonic speed for virtually silent operation.
Includes USB dual voltage wall-charger for your convenience. Fast disc vibration significantly shortens treatment time.

The Flyp Portable Handheld Nebulizer combines HypersoniQ technology and a compact design for an innovative nebulizer that has revolutionized the market. The lightweight, portable construction is smaller than a smartphone, fitting easily in your hand for operation and discreetly in your pocket or bag for convenient transport.

Innovative HypersoniQ technology utilizes an internal disc that vibrates at ultrasonic speed, 2,000 times faster than a hummingbird’s wings, shortening treatment time to a mere seven minutes for most medications. Medication passes through the holes in this internal disc to become an inhalable aerosol that you can breathe straight into your body with the easy, attached mouthpiece; no masks, tubes, or filters required. Just fill, click, breathe.

For even more convenience, the Flyp is powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery that can provide eight treatments before needing to be recharged. And when it does finally need to be charged, simply use the USB charger to charge it in a standard wall socket.

Cleaning Flyp is simple. Just fill the Medication Reservoir with distilled water, turn the unit on for one minute, then empty. Then gently remove the Mouthpiece, rinse under running water, and lay to dry on a clean towel.

Omron MicroAir Mesh Nebulizer,Omron's MicroAIR NE-U100 Nebulizer is a unique portable mesh nebulizer. The MicroAIR NE-U100 delivers instant relief at your fingertips, even on the go. Its compact size and battery-operation sets it apart from traditional nebulizers, which can be bulky and require a power outlet. The MicroAIR is travel-ready and easy to use whenever and wherever you need it. With a battery life of 4 hours on just 2 AA batteries, there's no need to worry about constantly charging.

Traditional nebulizers can also tend to be noisy. The Omron NE-U100 nebulizer is virtually silent, making it ideal for using with children, late at night, and in quiet places. You can discreetly use your nebulizer with a simple push of a button while not disturbing anyone around you.

The MicroAIR NE-U100 uses a unique mesh technology that delivers more medication into the lungs compared to most compressor nebulizers. All nebulizers convert liquid medicine into aerosol droplets to be easily inhaled. A portable mesh nebulizer uses a vibrating element oscillating at high frequency to push the medication through the mesh, generating aerosol droplets. There are many benefits to this technique, including using your nebulizer from any angle or position, whether lying down or standing up. This mesh technology also allows the nebulizer to be compact and silent.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hundreds of millions of people suffer worldwide from a chronic respiratory disease. Treatment of respiratory diseases often involves inhaled medication, through the use of a nebulizer. One of the great benefits of using a nebulizer is that the medication is delivered directly to the respiratory airways and lungs, allowing for higher concentration of medication in the target area.

What Comes with the Omron MicroAIR® NE-U100 Nebulizer?

MicroAIR NE-U100 includes the main unit with cover, medication bottle, mesh cap, mouthpiece, mouthpiece/mask adapter, storage/carrying case, child mask, 2 AA batteries, instulation manual, quick setup guide
The following accessories are optionally available (sold separately):
Omron's AC Adapter with Connection Stand ‒ uses your home’s electricity to power the MicroAir NE-U100 instead of batteries. No need to remove any installed batteries because the Nebulizer will not draw power from batteries while the AC Adapter is in use.
"AA" Alkaline Batteries ‒ the MicroAir requires two (2) batteries to operate the device. We offer a 4-pack of GE/Sanyo "AA" batteries for your convenience.

Handheld portable nebulizer with vibrating mesh nebulizer technology dispenses medication quickly and accurately on the go

OrthoWedge® Forefoot Off-Loading Healing Shoe,The DARCO OrthoWedge™ is clinically proven to reduce weight bearing pressure on the forefoot which promotes faster healing after surgery, trauma or when forefoot wounds or ulcerations are present.

Features and Benefits
Reduces forefoot pressure by as much as 57%!
Square-toe design acts as a bumper to protect the toes.
Ankle strap seats foot firmly in shoe to reduce heel slippage and eliminate friction.
Removable forefoot closure eliminates buckle pressure.
Zoned outsole has an aggressive tread under the midfoot.
EVA insole features twice the padding of standard insoles and can be modified as needed.
Indications
Post Surgical healing
Forefoot trauma
Wounds or ulcerations present under metatarsal heads and toes.
Any situation that requires a pressure off-load of the forefoot
Orthowedge Shoe for Forefoot Off-loading Relief

The key element that sets this bunion surgery shoe apart from other post surgery boots or shoes is its 15° dorsi-angle bottom. This makes users shift their weight to the mid- and heel area of the foot. The lack of pressure on the front of the foot and toes reduces pain and gives the injured area a chance to heal correctly. See BraceAbility’s full line of braces for foot conditions.

This lightweight and low-profile post surgery boot can help with a number of conditions, including:

Ulcers
Bunions or after a bunionectomy (surgery to repair a bunion)
Infection
Broken toes or forefoot fractures (including Lisfranc fractures)
Ball of foot pain from trauma or metatarsalgia

The other components of this toe fracture shoe are also designed with healing and user comfort in mind. For one, the toe fracture sandal has a square toe design that is roomy and acts as a protective bumper against further damage.

The bunionectomy shoe as a whole allows space for bandaging and swelling and the Velcro top closures of the medical shoe are adjustable so that one can cinch the shoe for toe fractures tighter once the swelling has subsided and/or the bandaging has been removed. See more orthotics for treating bunions.

The EVA medical shoe insoles of the support provide durable and comfortable support to the mid-foot. EVA, or ethlylene vinyl acetate, is a foam material that consists of thousands of foam bubbles filled with gas that make the material lightweight and flexible. The tricot lining of the foam is comfortable against the skin as well as durable.

Healing Shoe for Broken Toe, Post Surgery & Ulcerations

There are a number of conditions for which treatment requires limited or no weight bearing on the front of the foot. Obviously, this is a difficult task and one that compromises one’s mobility. While using crutches can get the job done, it can also result in one’s muscles wasting away in the meantime.

A preferable alternative in some cases is wearing a wedged orthotic such as this medical shoe that forces one to keep weight off the front of the foot by shifting pressure to the mid-foot and sole.

The lightweight, flexible EVA insole helps support the foot so one feels stable moving about on the wedged orthotic. And the square-toe design and highly adjustable fit of the sandal for toe fractures means the support can easily accommodate a swollen or bandaged foot.

Post Bunion Surgery Walking Shoe to Protect Toe

This convenient shoe for bunions, fractures, ulcers and more enables one to conveniently rest the front of the foot and toes. Some of its features that enable the medical shoe to do so include the following:

Orthowedge design with 15° dorsi-angle bottom
This keeps pressure off the forefoot and toes and shifts weight bearing to the mid-foot and heel
Square-toe design
Wide, open toe area acts as a protective bumper
Open design for breathability
Velcro straps can accommodate changes in bandaging and swelling
Two straps for a secure fit
EVA foam insole for lightweight support and comfort
Durable tricot lining
Black color
Treats: ulcers, bunions, infections, forefoot pain, fractures of the toes or forefoot bones, post-surgical care
Intended to be worn while healing from a broken toe or other issue where you don't want your toes from hitting the ground when walking.
Very adjustable, lightweight and can be worn on either foot
4 sizes which fit kids and adults
Doctor recommended medical / hospital grade post-surgery or post-injury healing shoe that you can use at home during recovery.

Small weighs 12 ounces, Medium weights 14.2 ounces, Large weighs 15.6 ounces, and X-Large weighs 1 pound 5 ounces.
